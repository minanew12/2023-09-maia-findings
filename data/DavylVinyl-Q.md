# This lack of proper documentation and inline comments

## Impact
Lack of inline documentation in the code can have a significant impact on the maintainability and understandability of the contract. Without sufficient inline comments and explanations, it becomes challengin to comprehend the code's functionality and purpose. This lack of documentation can lead to misunderstandings, increase the likelihood of coding errors. Also resulting in delays in development, debugging, and the identification of vulnerabilities.

## Proof of Concept
This vulnerability is a documentation issue and does not require a direct proof of concept. However, we can provide an example from the code to illustrate the lack of inline documentation:

```solidity
/**
 * @title  Multicall Root Router Contract
 * ...
 */
contract MulticallRootRouter is IRootRouter, Ownable {
    ...

    /**
     * @notice Initializes the Multicall Root Router.
     * @param _bridgeAgentAddress The address of the Bridge Agent.
     */
    function initialize(address _bridgeAgentAddress) external onlyOwner {
        require(_bridgeAgentAddress != address(0), "Bridge Agent Address cannot be 0");

        bridgeAgentAddress = payable(_bridgeAgentAddress);
        bridgeAgentExecutorAddress = IBridgeAgent(_bridgeAgentAddress).bridgeAgentExecutorAddress();
        renounceOwnership();
    }

    ...
}
```

In the code snippet above, there is a brief comment provided for the `initialize` function, which explains its purpose and the expected parameter. However, other parts of the code, such as variable declarations, complex logic, and contract interactions, lack inline comments and explanations. Without detailed documentation, it may be challenging in future scenarios amongst other aspect of the code too.

## Tools Used
The identification of this issue was based on a manual code review.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
To mitigate the lack of inline documentation, it is essential to add detailed comments and explanations to clarify the purpose and functionality of each part of the code. Developers and auditors should document variable declarations, complex logic, contract interactions, and any other critical aspects of the code. Here's an example of adding inline documentation to a variable declaration:

```solidity
/**
 * @title  Multicall Root Router Contract
 * ...
 */
contract MulticallRootRouter is IRootRouter, Ownable {
    ...

    // Address for Local Port Address where assets are stored and managed.
    address public immutable localPortAddress;

    /**
     * @notice Constructor for Multicall Root Router.
     * @param _localChainId local layer zero chain id.
     * @param _localPortAddress address of the root Port.
     * @param _multicallAddress address of the Multicall contract.
     */
    constructor(uint256 _localChainId, address _localPortAddress, address _multicallAddress) {
        require(_localPortAddress != address(0), "Local Port Address cannot be 0");
        require(_multicallAddress != address(0), "Multicall Address cannot be 0");

        localChainId = _localChainId;
        localPortAddress = _localPortAddress;
        multicallAddress = _multicallAddress;
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }

    ...
}
```

Sample comments have been added to explain the purpose of the `localPortAddress` variable and the parameters of the constructor function. By consistently providing detailed inline documentation, developers and auditors can better understand the code's functionality and purpose, leading to improved code quality and security.
