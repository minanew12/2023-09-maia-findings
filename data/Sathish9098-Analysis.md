# Maia DAO - Ulyss Analysis

## Overview

``Ulysses Protocol`` is a decentralized and permissionless liquidity protocol that aims to promote ``capital efficiency`` in the face of an increasingly ``fragmented liquidity landscape`` in DeFi. It enables ``liquidity providers`` to deploy their ``assets`` from ``one chain`` and earn revenue from activity in an ``array of chains``, all while mitigating the ``negative effects`` of current market solutions. Additionally, it offers a way for DeFi protocols to lower their ``operational`` and ``managing costs`` by incentivizing liquidity for a single unified liquidity token instead of managing incentives for pools scattered across different ``AMMs`` and ``chains``

 #### High-level overview of how Ulysses Protocol works
 - Liquidity providers ``deposit`` their assets into a Ulysses ``liquidity pool`` on a single chain
 - Ulysses ``cross-chain messaging`` is used to communicate with ``liquidity pools`` on other chains
 - ``Liquidity providers`` earn yield from across ``multiple chains``, even though their assets are only deposited on a ``single chain``.
 - DeFi protocols can use ``Ulysses Unified Liquidity`` Tokens to access liquidity from across ``multiple chains`` without having to manage incentives for pools scattered across different ``AMMs`` and ``chains``.
 
## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

- ``Preliminary analysis``: I read the contest ``Readme.md`` file and took the following notes:

- The ``Maia DAO - Ulysses`` learnings,
  -  Inheritance 
  -  Test coverage is 69% 
  -  Uses L2, Multi-Chain, Side-Chain, ERC-20 Token, Timelock function
  -  Using Layerzero Messaging layer
#### Areas to focus
 - Double spending of deposit and settlement nonces / assets (Bridge Agents and Bridge Agent Executors).
 - Griefing of user deposits and settlements (Bridge Agents).
 - Bricking of Bridge Agent and subsequent Omnichain dApps that rely on it.
 - Circumventing Bridge Agent's encoding rules to manipulate remote chain state.

#### Main invariants
 1. The total balance of any given Virtualized Liquidity Token should never be greater than the amount of Underlying Tokens deposited in the asset's origin chain Branch Port.
 2. A Deposit / Settlement can never be redeemable and retryable at the same time.


- ``High-level overview`` : I analyzed the ``overall codebase`` in one iteration to get a high-level understanding of the ``code structure`` and ``functionality``.

- ``Documentation review`` : I studied the ``documentation`` to understand the purpose of ``each contract``, its ``functionality``, and how it is ``connected`` with other contracts.

- ``Literature review`` : I read ``old audits`` and ``known findings``, as well as the ``bot races findings``.

- ``Testing setup`` : I set up my ``testing environment`` and ran the tests to ensure that ``all tests passed``. I used ``Foundry`` to test the ``Maia DAO - Ulysses`` , and I used ``forge comments`` for testing.
  - forge build
  - forge test

- ``Detailed analysis`` : I started with the ``detailed analysis`` of the code base, line by line. I took the ``necessary notes`` to ask some questions to the ``sponsors``.

## Architecture recommendations

![ulysses_with_liquidity (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58845085/273201803-b407ca3d-332a-4baf-9e70-a06ffc3d0aba.png)



### Concerns Regarding Excessive Centralization in Ports, Bridges, and Routers

Regarding the centralization of ports, bridges, and routers in the protocol's architecture is valid. When these components are centralized, it introduces a single point of failure and potential vulnerabilities that can lead to unexpected behavior across the entire protocol.

Here are some considerations related to centralization in the context of ``ports``, ``bridges``, and ``routers``

``Single Point of Failure``: Centralized components can become a single point of failure. If any issues or disruptions occur with these components, it can impact the overall functionality of the protocol, potentially causing downtime or operational disruptions.

``Security Risk``s: Centralized components may present security risks. Malicious actors might target these components to exploit vulnerabilities, compromise the protocol's security, or steal assets.

``Lack of Redundancy``: Without decentralization and redundancy, there's limited backup or failover mechanisms in place. If a centralized component fails, there may be no backup to maintain the protocol's operations.

#### Mitigation

- Consider decentralizing critical components like ports, bridges, and routers to distribute control and reduce the risk of single points of failure
- Establish contingency plans and redundancy mechanisms to ensure the protocol can continue functioning even if one component encounters issues

### Use a more efficient data structure to store the Port data and branch data

The current data structure used by the Ports and bridges is a ``simple mapping`` . This data structure can be ``inefficient`` for ``certain operations``, such as querying the total balance of all assets in a Port and bridges. One way to improve the efficiency of the Ports and bridges is to use a more ``sophisticated data structure``, such as a ``Merkle tree``. This would allow the Ports and bridges to quickly query the total balance of all assets in a Port and brances, as well as the balance of any individual asset

### Implement a load balancing mechanism to distribute traffic across multiple Ports

The current architecture of the Ports and bridges is ``centralized``, with all traffic being routed through a ``single Port`` and single bridge. This can be a ``bottleneck``, especially if the Port and bridges is under a lot of ``load``. One way to improve the ``scalability`` of the Ports is to implement a ``load balancing mechanism``. This would distribute traffic across ``multiple Ports``, which would help to improve ``performance`` and ``reliability``


![Ulysses_Omnichain_Flow-fec685de51a96e209b8b40cfd49868e9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58845085/272959712-8c5f3333-eaeb-4779-b95a-69a2e700c87b.png)

Again the single Root Bridge Agent can be a single point of failure in a cross-chain bridge system. If the Root Bridge Agent is compromised or unavailable, the entire system can be impacted. This is a serious security risk, as it could allow an attacker to steal funds or disrupt the operation of the system.

To mitigate the risk of a single Root Bridge Agent being a single point of failure

### Implement a monitoring system
Monitor the Root Bridge Agents to detect and respond to any problems. This could be achieved using a combination of tools and techniques, such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

### Implement a disaster recovery plan
Have a disaster recovery plan in place to minimize the impact of any outages or disruptions. This plan should include steps such as backing up the Root Bridge Agent data and deploying the Root Bridge Agents to a secondary environment in the event of an outage.

### Use a queuing system
Queueing systems are useful for handling spikes in traffic because they can buffer requests and process them in a timely manner. This is especially important for ``Bridge Agents``, as they need to be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests from users.

One way to implement a queuing system for Bridge Agents is to use a message broker such as ``RabbitMQ`` or ``Kafka``. Message brokers are designed to handle large volumes of messages and can provide high performance and reliability.

``RabbitMQ`` - ``RabbitMQ`` is a popular message broker that is often used in ``DeFi applications``. It is a highly scalable and reliable queuing system that can handle ``large volumes`` of messages.

``Kafka``: Kafka is another popular message broker that is often used in ``DeFi applications``. It is a distributed queuing system that is well-suited for processing ``high volumes of streaming data``.


#### Possible risks using LayerZero messaging layer 

  - ``Complexity``: The LayerZero messaging layer is a complex system, and it can be difficult to understand and use. This can make it challenging for developers to build applications on top of LayerZero.
  
  - ``Security``: The LayerZero messaging layer is still under development, and there is some concern about its security. For example, there have been some reports of attacks on LayerZero-based applications.
  
  - ``Centralization``: The LayerZero messaging layer is currently centralized, meaning that it is controlled by a single team. This centralization could pose a risk if the team were to be compromised or decide to abandon the project.
  
  - ``Cost``: The LayerZero messaging layer can be expensive to use. This is because it requires a lot of computing power to process messages.


## Codebase quality analysis

- You have done a good job providing comments for various parts of your contract. However, it's important to ensure that the comments are clear and provide sufficient information for someone reading the code. Make sure to explain the purpose and functionality of the contract's functions and variables.
- Conventionally, modifiers are often placed before the function declaration.This makes the code more readable as it's clear which modifiers apply to a function.
- Instead of using raw numbers like 1e4 and 3e3, consider defining named constants to make the code more readable and maintainable
- Consider using require for input validation instead of if statements. This provides better readability and ensures that the function reverts if the condition is not met
- Organize your functions in a logical order within the contract
- Emit events with descriptive names and include relevant information. Events are essential for tracking contract interactions and debugging
- Be cautious when using address(this) as it can have security implications. Make sure that only trusted contracts can call your functions with this address
- The contract uses multiple modifiers in some functions, leading to a complex modifier chain

## Centralization risks

The following functions in the ``BranchPort.sol`` and ``RootPort.sol`` files are related to the single point of failure

- ``initialize()``: This function is used to initialize the BranchPort or RootPort contract. It takes the addresses of the CoreBranchRouter and BridgeAgentFactory contracts as arguments.
- ``renounceOwnership()`` : This function is used to renounce ownership of the BranchPort or RootPort contract.
- ``toggleBridgeAgent()`` and ``addBridgeAgentFactory()``: These functions are used to toggle or add BridgeAgent contracts.
- ``toggleBridgeAgentFactory()``: This function is used to toggle a BridgeAgentFactory contract.
- ``addNewChain()``: This function is used to add a new chain to the protocol.
- ``addEcosystemToken()``: This function is used to add a new ecosystem token to the protocol.
- ``setCoreBranchRouter()``: This function is used to set the CoreBranchRouter contract address.
- ``setCoreRootRouter()``: This function is used to set the CoreRootRouter contract address.
- ``syncNewCoreBranchRouter()``: This function is used to sync a new CoreBranchRouter contract address.

All of these functions are restricted to the ``only owner`` of the ``BranchPort`` or ``RootPort`` contract. This means that the only owner has complete control over the contract and can make any changes they want.

If the ``only owner`` is ``compromised``, the ``attacker`` could use these functions to ``steal funds``, ``disrupt`` the operation of the ``system``, or ``manipulate`` the ``price of assets``.

### Possible Mitigation Steps

- ``multi-signature wallet``
``Multi-signature`` wallet to control the only owner account. This would require multiple people to ``sign off`` on transactions, making it more difficult for an ``attacker`` to ``gain control`` of the account.
- ``Decentralized governance system ``
Decentralized governance system to give users a say in the management of the protocol. This would make it more difficult for the only owner to make decisions that could harm the protocol
- ``Use role based owners``
By using role-based owners, you can reduce the risk of a compromised only owner impacting your protocol. If an attacker were to gain control of one of the roles, they would only be able to make changes related to that role 

## Mechanism review

The omnichain architecture employs several key mechanisms:

``Ports``: Ports serve as liquidity repositories and vaults for specific tokens, facilitating deposit and withdrawal actions without protocol fees. Branch Ports within each chain and the Root Port in the Root Chain manage token pools.

``Virtualized Liquidity``: This mechanism enables assets to remain locked in their respective chains while providing liquidity across multiple chains. It enhances capital efficiency and enables participation in various pools and protocols.

``Bridge Agents``: Bridge Agents act as intermediaries, ensuring seamless communication between chains. Branch and Root Bridge Agents mediate interactions and manage settlements between different chains.

``Routers``: Branch and Root Routers facilitate cross-chain interactions. Branch Routers handle user-facing entry and exit points within the omnichain system, while Root Routers connect to the Root Chain and interact with various applications, enabling customizable actions before, during, and after cross-chain interactions.

These mechanisms work together to optimize ``liquidity provision``, ``reduce operational costs``, and enable ``composability`` across the ecosystem.

## Systemic risks

### Consensus Mechanism Compatibility
Different blockchains may use different ``consensus mechanisms`` (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake). Ensuring ``compatibility`` and security when ``transferring assets`` between chains with ``different consensus mechanisms`` is a challenge.

### Scaling Issues
Scaling an ``omnichain architecture`` to handle a large number of ``chains``, ``routers``, and users can be a significant challenge. Ensuring that the system remains performant under ``heavy loads`` is crucial.

### Token Standards
Different blockchains may use different ``token standards`` (e.g., ``ERC-20``, ``BEP-20``). Handling tokens with ``different standards`` and ensuring ``compatibility`` can be ``complex``.

### Cross-Chain Liquidity
Managing ``liquidity`` across multiple chains to support ``withdrawals`` and deposits efficiently can be complex, especially during periods of ``high demand``.

### Interoperability risks in LayerZero messaging layer
The ``LayerZero messaging layer`` is still relatively new, and it is not yet ``interoperable`` with ``all blockchain networks``

### Scalability risks in LayerZero messaging layer
It is not yet clear how well the ``LayerZero messaging layer`` will scale to handle ``large volumes`` of ``traffic``

### Smart contract vulnerabilities
Smart contracts are the foundation of the ``Ulysses Protocol``, and any vulnerabilities in these contracts could be exploited by ``attackers`` to steal funds or ``disrupt`` the operation of the protocol.

### Regulatory risks
The ``Ulysses Protocol`` is a decentralized protocol, but it is still subject to ``regulation``. If there are changes in ``regulation`` that impact the ``Ulysses Protocol``, it could impact the ``adoption`` and use of the ``protocol``.

### Concentration risks
Virtualized Liquidity systems are often ``centralized``, with a small number of ``actors`` controlling the ``system``. This concentration of power could lead to ``abuse or failure``.

### Cross-Chain Slippage
Variations in prices and liquidity across different chains can lead to slippage for users conducting cross-chain swaps. Managing and minimizing slippage is a challenge.

### Network Congestion
In periods of high demand, ``network congestion`` can occur, leading to delays and higher ``transaction costs``. Have strategies in place to manage and optimize transactions during such periods.

### Resource Scaling Risks
Be prepared to scale ``Bridge Agents`` resources, such as computing ``power`` and ``bandwidth``, as the platform grows to ``accommodate increased demand``.

### Systemic Risks Based On CodeBase Analysis

[2023-09-maia/src/RootPort.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/RootPort.sol)

- The contract has multiple initialization functions (``initialize`` and ``initializeCore``) that should be called in a ``specific order``. If these functions are not called ``correctly`` or in the ``wrong order``, it could lead to ``improper contract setup``.
- Be cautious about potential reentrancy vulnerabilities when interacting with external contracts, especially in functions like ``bridgeToRoot()`` and ``bridgeToRootFromLocalBranch()`` , bridgeToLocalBranchFromRoot() .
- The contract uses ``several mappings``, which can be expensive in terms of ``gas costs`` and ``storage``. Ensure that the ``storage costs`` are considered and that there is ``no excessive storage`` usage that could impact scalability
- Unable to remove ``BridgeAgent`` once added to array. We can toggle the ``isBridgeAgent[_bridgeAgent]`` value but not possible to remove completely 
- The contract uses an ``Ownable pattern`` to manage ``ownership`` and access control. If the ``owner`` account is ``compromised`` or ``misuses`` their power, it could have ``systemic consequences``.
- The contract allows ``adding`` and toggling ``Bridge Agents``. If ``malicious`` or ``untrusted Bridge`` Agents are added, they could manipulate the contract's behavior and impact the entire system's ``security`` and ``stability``
- The contract synchronizes with ``other chains`` and ``agents``. If ``synchronization fails`` or is ``tampered`` with, it could disrupt the entire ``system's functionality``

[2023-09-maia/src/BranchBridgeAgent.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/BranchBridgeAgent.sol)

- The ``_performCall`` function is called from multiple external functions without proper checks to ``prevent reentrancy``. If the called contract performs an external call back into this contract, it could re-enter the same function before the ``previous call`` completes
- The contract handles ``deposits`` with ``increasing nonces``, but it doesn't track or ``limit the maximum nonce``, which could lead to a growing ``storage size over time``.  Functions related to deposit handling, including ``callOutAndBridge``, ``callOutAndBridgeMultiple``, ``retryDeposit``, ``retrieveDeposit``, and ``redeemDeposit``.
- The contract uses a ``mapping`` to track if a given ``settlement nonce`` has been executed. If this ``mapping grows`` without ``bounds``, it could lead to ``higher gas costs`` and potential ``denial-of-service attacks ``. The ``executionState`` mapping used in functions related to settlement execution, such as ``retrySettlement``.
- The contract includes a fallback function (``receive()``), but it's not clear what ``purpose`` this ``function serves``
- The contract relies heavily on data ``serialization`` and ``deserialization`` for ``cross-chain calls``, and errors in this process could lead to ``incorrect`` or ``failed transactions``
- The ``getFeeEstimate`` function estimates gas fees based on external contract calls. Depending on external contracts for gas estimation could lead to ``incorrect fee calculations`` and ``failed transactions``
- The contract includes functionality to toggle fallback behavior based on a boolean flag (``_hasFallbackToggled``). Depending on how this flag is set, it could potentially introduce ``unexpected behavior`` or ``vulnerabilities``.

## Implementation Suggestions

### Considering upgradeable contracts and proxies for future updates

By incorporating ``upgradeable contracts`` and ``proxies``, you can position ``Ulysses Protocol`` as a dynamic and robust DeFi platform, capable of evolving to meet the changing needs of the DeFi community while maintaining trust and security.

### Test Coverage 

The test coverage analysis for the codebase reveals an overall coverage percentage of ``55.05%``. While this represents some test coverage, it's essential to acknowledge that ``achieving higher coverag``e levels is generally advisable for ensuring the ``reliability`` and ``robustness`` of the code

The areas with relatively higher coverage include ``ArbitrumBranchPort.sol (100%)``, ``RootBridgeAgent.sol (76.50%)``, and ``BranchBridgeAgent.sol (79.87%)``. However, there are critical components like ``VirtualAccount.sol (40.00%)`` and ``MulticallRootRouter.sol (74.44%)`` that have lower coverage percentages, which could be a ``potential source of vulnerabilities``.

it's advisable to work on the following actions to enhance the codebase's quality

``Augment Coverage``: Identify sections with the lowest coverage percentages and prioritize the creation of comprehensive test suites for these areas. Particular attention should be given to contracts like VirtualAccount.sol to bolster their reliability and security.

``Test Edge Cases``: Ensure that tests cover edge cases, exceptional scenarios, and corner cases to simulate real-world conditions effectively.

``Test Documentation``: Maintain thorough documentation for tests, explaining their purpose, coverage, and expected outcomes. This documentation aids in understanding the rationale behind specific test cases.

### Solidity Versions
If you are using a floating version of Solidity, such as ^0.8.0, this means that your codebase will be compatible with all versions of Solidity from ``^0.8.0`` to the latest version. This can be useful if you are not sure which version of Solidity you want to use, or if you need to support multiple versions of Solidity.

Overall, I would recommend using the ``latest version`` like ``0.8.20`` or ``0.8.21`` of Solidity if possible.

### Comments
Comments can be very helpful for both auditors and developers, especially in complex codebases. I also agree that the codebase you are describing is generally clean and strategically straightforward, but there are a few sections that could benefit from additional comments.

#### Some specific tips for commenting :

- Add comments to explain complex code
- Add comments to document your design decisions
- Add comments to document your design decisions
- Use clear and concise language

## Conclusion

Ulysses Protocol is a ``forward-thinking decentralized finance`` (DeFi) project with a mission to tackle the growing issue of ``liquidity fragmentation`` across various ``blockchain networks``. It introduces innovative concepts like ``Virtualized`` and ``Unified Liquidity Management``, which aim to create a unified liquidity token representing ``assets`` from ``different chains``, thereby enabling seamless composability across a range of ``DeFi`` platforms. By doing so, Ulysses Protocol ``empowers liquidity providers`` to deploy their assets across ``multiple chains``, optimizing capital efficiency and ``revenue generation`` while mitigating the challenges posed by the current fragmented ``liquidity landscape``. Moreover, the protocol offers a solution for DeFi projects to reduce operational costs by incentivizing liquidity for a ``single unified token``, simplifying management and ``lowering overhead``. With cross-chain capabilities and a focus on community ownership, Ulysses Protocol appears poised to make a significant impact in the DeFi space, provided it can strike the right balance between innovation and security and offer clear education and documentation to users and developers.
