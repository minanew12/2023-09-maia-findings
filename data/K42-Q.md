# Q/A Report for Maia-DAO-Ulysses
- I focused on some of the main contracts I saw for Q/A improvements for during my gas optimizations and analysis reporting for efficiency:

## Q/A [BaseBranchRouter.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/BaseBranchRouter.sol) Contract

### Possible Optimization 1: Use IERC20 Interface for Token Approvals




```solidity
// Current Code:
ERC20(_hToken).approve(_localPortAddress, _amount - _deposit);

// Optimized Code:
IERC20(_hToken).approve(_localPortAddress, _amount - _deposit);
```




- **Rationale**: Using the IERC20 interface instead of ERC20 can make the contract more flexible and potentially reduce bytecode size, enhancing the contract's security by adhering to standard interfaces.

- **Security Improvements**: The use of the IERC20 standard interface simplifies the code and adheres to established best practices, reducing the attack surface.

### Possible Optimization 2: Optimize the `lock()` Modifier




```solidity
// Current Code:
modifier lock() {
    require(_unlocked == 1);
    _unlocked = 2;
    _;
    _unlocked = 1;
}


// Optimized Code:
modifier lock() {
    uint256 originalState = _unlocked;
    _unlocked = 2;
    _;
    _unlocked = originalState;
}
```




- **Rationale**: The optimization ensures that the `_unlocked` state variable is restored to its original state, making it safer in scenarios where nested calls might occur.
- **Security Improvements**: The code becomes more robust against re-entrancy attacks by ensuring the original state is restored, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities due to nested or malicious calls.

## Q/A for [BranchBridgeAgent.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/BranchBridgeAgent.sol)

### Possible Optimization: Use External Calls Last (Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern)




```solidity
// Current Code:
depositNonce = _depositNonce + 1;
IPort(localPortAddress).bridgeOut(msg.sender, _hToken, _token, _amount, _deposit);


// Optimized Code:
IPort(localPortAddress).bridgeOut(msg.sender, _hToken, _token, _amount, _deposit);
depositNonce = _depositNonce + 1;
```




- **Rationale**: By adhering to the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, the optimized code reduces the risk of re-entrancy attacks.

- **Security Improvements**: The change increases the contract's security by ensuring that state changes occur after external calls, reducing the risk associated with re-entrancy attacks.
