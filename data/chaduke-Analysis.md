A. Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings

B. Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

C. Architecture recommendations
   1) The complexity is greatly increased by ``RootBridgeAgentExecutor``  and ``BranchBridgeAgentExecutor``.   As a result, many interactions between ``RootBridgeAgent`` and other components have to go through ``RootBridgeAgentExecutor``. The same is true for ``BranchBridgeAgentExecutor``. 

   Mitigation: combine ``RootBridgeAgentExecutor`` into ``RootBridgeAgent``; combine ``BranchBridgeAgentExecutor`` into ``BranchBridgeAgent``. 

   2) The communication between between CoreRootRouter and RootBridgeAgent can be direct instead of via RootPort. For example, consider the flow CoreRootRouter._syncBranchBridgeAgent() -> rootPortAddress.syncBranchBridgeAgentWithRoot() -> _rootBridgeAgent.syncBranchBridgeAgent(_newBranchBridgeAgent, _branchChainId). The complexity can be reduced if CoreRootRouter._syncBranchBridgeAgent() calls _rootBridgeAgent.syncBranchBridgeAgent(_newBranchBridgeAgent, _branchChainId) directly.
