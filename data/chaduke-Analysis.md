A. Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings

B. Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

C. Architecture recommendations
   1) The complexity is greatly increased by ``RootBridgeAgentExecutor``  and ``BranchBridgeAgentExecutor``.   As a result, many interactions between ``RootBridgeAgent`` and other components have to go through ``RootBridgeAgentExecutor``. The same is true for ``BranchBridgeAgentExecutor``. 

   Mitigation: combine ``RootBridgeAgentExecutor`` into ``RootBridgeAgent``; combine ``BranchBridgeAgentExecutor`` into ``BranchBridgeAgent``. 

   2) The communication between between CoreRootRouter and RootBridgeAgent can be direct instead of via RootPort. For example, consider the flow CoreRootRouter._syncBranchBridgeAgent() -> rootPortAddress.syncBranchBridgeAgentWithRoot() -> _rootBridgeAgent.syncBranchBridgeAgent(_newBranchBridgeAgent, _branchChainId). The complexity can be reduced if CoreRootRouter._syncBranchBridgeAgent() calls _rootBridgeAgent.syncBranchBridgeAgent(_newBranchBridgeAgent, _branchChainId) directly. 

D. Codebase quality analysis
    
E. Centralization risks
    
F. Mechanism review
   1) ``CoreRootRouter`` should focus on the functionality of "routing". Since the functionality of ``_addLocalToken``,  ``_setLocalToken``, ``_syncBranchBridgeAgent`` are implemented in ``BranchBridgeAgent.sol``, these internal functions should be moved to ``c.sol``. Currently, these internal functions just unwrap the payload and then wrap another payload to call ``BranchBridgeAgent.sol`` - a waste of time and only make the code harder to manage. Simplicity is the key for security. 
   
G. Systemic risks
