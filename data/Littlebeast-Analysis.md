# Maia DAO - Ulysses Advanced analysis Report

## Introduction
 Maia DAO's Ulysses Protocol in Code4rena is a critical step towards ensuring the security and reliability of a complex DeFi platform. Ulysses Protocol is a decentralized and permissionless 'Omnichain Liquidity Protocol' designed to address the challenges of liquidity fragmentation in the DeFi space. This advanced analysis report aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the Ulysses Protocol and the key components under audit.

## Ulysses Protocol Overview
Ulysses Protocol is designed to promote capital efficiency in the DeFi sector by allowing liquidity providers to deploy their assets on one chain while earning revenue from activities across multiple chains. It achieves this through two major components: Virtualized and Unified Liquidity Management.

**Virtualized Liquidity Management:*** This component allows assets locked in different chains to be mirrored within a single liquidity management environment. This innovation enables liquidity providers to offer liquidity across multiple chains and earn revenue from various DeFi activities while mitigating impermanent loss.

**Unified Liquidity Management:** Ulysses aims to introduce a single token representing a stable LP across different chains, enabling full composability for DeFi protocols. This means the token can be utilized in various AMMs like Uniswap V3, Money Markets like Aave, and more.

### Ports
The Ulysses Protocol relies on Ports as the foundation of its omnichain architecture. Ports are liquidity repositories responsible for retaining and managing capital deposited on different chains where Ulysses operates. There are two types of Ports:

**Branch Ports:** Each chain has one Branch Port responsible for handling user requests and system responses. They serve as vaults with single-asset pools for each omnichain token on a specific chain. Importantly, no protocol fees are charged when interacting with a Branch Port.

**Root Port:** The Root Port, located on the Root Chain, maintains the global state of Virtualized Tokens. It manages mappings from underlying to local addresses and plays a pivotal role in token addition, removal, and balance verification.

### Virtual Liquidity
'Virtual Liquidity' is a novel concept introduced by Ulysses Protocol. It refers to the ability to provide liquidity and earn revenue from assets locked in different chains while keeping those assets locked in their respective chains. This innovation greatly enhances capital efficiency and reduces impermanent loss for liquidity providers.

The Branch hTokens created through Virtualized Liquidity can be used in various pools and protocols, offering liquidity providers the opportunity to earn income across multiple chains. Furthermore, this approach also reduces operational and management costs for DeFi protocols by incentivizing liquidity for a single unified liquidity token.

### Bridge Agents
Bridge Agents serve as intermediaries that facilitate seamless communication between different chains within the Ulysses Protocol. They ensure smooth connections, transmit user requests, and manage system responses. There are two types of Bridge Agents:

**Branch Bridge Agents:** These mediate interactions with Branch Routers, tracking user deposits, communicating with local Branch Ports, and engaging with virtualized token contracts.

**Root Bridge Agents:** Located on the Root Chain, these liaise with all connected Branch Chains and their respective Branch Bridge Agents. They also monitor pending user settlements, facilitating integration with other dApps in the Root Chain.

### Routers
Routers play a vital role in Ulysses Protocol as they enable customized actions during omnichain interactions. There are two types of Routers:

**Branch Routers:** These serve as user-facing entry and exit points within the omnichain system. They initiate state changes within the origin Branch Chain's contract and communicate with the connected Branch Bridge Agents.

**Root Routers:** Located on the Root Chain, Root Routers connect to Root Bridge Agents and interact with various applications in the Root Chain. This interaction includes engaging with platforms like UniswapV3, Maia Vaults, and Hermes Gauges, as well as their voting systems.
