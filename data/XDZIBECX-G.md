## first issue gas consume :
in these, two functions https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/f5ba4de628836b2a29f9b5fff59499690008c463/src/ArbitrumCoreBranchRouter.sol#L46C1-L119C6 
- so we have he addLocalToken function is an external function that allows users to add a local token to the contract and It takes _underlyingAddress as a parameter, which represents the address of the underlying token.
Inside the function, data is encoded to create parameters for a cross-chain request, and The _receiveAddBridgeAgent function is an internal function that is called within the contract It is responsible for deploying and adding a new bridge agent for a token that is already active in the global environment in the Root Chain This function takes several parameters, including _branchBridgeAgentFactory, _rootBridgeAgent, _rootBridgeAgentFactory, _refundee, and _gParams It checks if the _branchBridgeAgentFactory is a valid BridgeAgentFactory and creates a new bridge agent.
It then creates a payload to call a specific function (bytes1(0x04)) with the relevant data.
A cross-chain request is sent using the callOutSystem function, targeting _refundee, with specified gas parameters.
the problem is  the addLocalToken function allows users to trigger the _receiveAddBridgeAgent function with arbitrary _refundee and _gParams values, including setting _gParams to use excessive gas high gas limit. This can lead to a situation where a user exploits this function to consume excessive gas and cause out-of-gas errors in the contract, potentially disrupting its operation.
- as an examlpe : An attacker calls the addLocalToken function and specifies arbitrary values for _refundee and _gParams, including setting an extremely high gas limit. This transaction consumes a significant amount of gas and causes an out-of-gas error, effectively halting the contract's execution and making it temporarily unusable.
