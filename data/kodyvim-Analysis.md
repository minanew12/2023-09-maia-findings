# Maia DAO - Ulysses Analysis Report
## Mechanism review
**Ports for Omnichain Architecture:**
  Ports are the foundational components of the protocol's omnichain architecture. They act as liquidity repositories responsible for managing and retaining capital deposited on each different chain where Ulysses operates.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/BranchPort.sol#L17
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/RootPort.sol#L16
   **Mechanism:** Ports serve as vaults with single-asset pools for each omnichain token active on a given chain. When users interact with Ports to deposit or withdraw assets, no protocol fees are charged from user assets. Ports are categorized into Branch Ports for individual chains and a Root Port on the Root Chain for global management.

**Virtualized Liquidity:**
   Virtualized liquidity is a core concept of the Ulysses Protocol. It involves connecting Ports within a Pool and Spoke architecture, comprising the Root Chain and multiple Branch Chains. This concept ensures that assets deposited on one chain are recognized as distinct from the same assets on different chains.
   **Mechanism:** The protocol maintains token balances and address mappings across different chains to achieve virtualized liquidity. This involves complex bookkeeping to ensure assets are tracked accurately across the ecosystem.

**Arbitrary Cross-Chain Execution:**
   Ulysses Protocol enables arbitrary cross-chain execution through a set of expandable routers, such as the Multicall Root Router, which can be permissionlessly deployed through Bridge Agent Factories. These routers facilitate secure asset movement between chains.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/MulticallRootRouter.sol#L57
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/RootBridgeAgent.sol#L32
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/BranchBridgeAgent.sol#L45
   **Mechanism:** The routers and bridge agents are implemented as smart contracts and are responsible for ensuring the proper movement of assets and data between chains. This involves complex data parsing and cryptographic operations to maintain security during cross-chain transactions.

**Virtual Account for dApps in Arbitrum:**
   The Virtual Account simplifies user balance management for dApps operating in the Arbitrum root chain environment. It allows users to access their balances and interact with Arbitrum-based dApps from other chains.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-maia/blob/main/src/VirtualAccount.sol#L17
   **Mechanism:** The Virtual Account is implemented as a smart contract and is integrated with the Ulysses branch chain and Arbitrum. It maintains user balances, allowing them to perform various actions like token swapping, liquidity provision, and yield farming within Arbitrum-based dApps.

## Codebase quality analysis
| Category | Description |
|--- | --- |
|Access Controls | **Satisfactory**. Appropriate access controls were in place for performing privileged operations.|
|Arithmetic | **Moderate**. The contracts uses solidity version ^0.8.0 potentially safe from overflow/underflow but care should be taken on arithmetic when parsing multiple deposit/settlement |
| Centralization | **satisfactory**. Permission-less and Critical functionalities are changed/Modified by On-chain governance.|
| Code Complexity | **Moderate**. Most part of the protocol were easy to understand, it depends on have data parsing on multiple operation |
|Contract Upgradeability | **Satisfactory**. Contracts are not upgradable.|
| Documentation | **Satisfactory**. High-level documentation and some in-line comments describing the functionality of the protocol were available.|
| Monitoring | **Satisfactory**. Events are emitted on performing critical actions.|

Very **Neat** and **Tide** codebase!

# Systemic risks
**Cross-Chain Risks:** As a multichain protocol, Ulysses operates on multiple blockchain networks. Risks related to interoperability and cross-chain interactions can be a concern. If there are issues with cross-chain communication, asset movement, or protocol compatibility, it can have systemic implications across the supported chains.

**Chain-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Each blockchain within the Ulysses ecosystem may have its own unique vulnerabilities or issues. A vulnerability on one chain can potentially affect the assets or operations that are bridged to other chains.

**Liquidity Fragmentation:** Managing liquidity across multiple chains can be challenging. If liquidity becomes fragmented or imbalanced on certain chains, it can impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the protocol as a whole.

**Oracles Across Chains:** If Ulysses relies on oracles that provide data from various chains, inaccuracies or manipulation of data from any of these oracles can affect the integrity of the entire system.

**Chain-Specific Market Risks:** Each blockchain may experience different market conditions and price volatility. Market downturns or extreme price movements on one chain can influence the value of assets and the behavior of users on that chain, potentially affecting the entire protocol.


# Centralization risks
**Governance Centralization:** critical functionalities are controlled by on-chain governance, if governance mechanism is concentrated in the hands of a small number of individuals or entities, it can lead to decision-making that does not reflect the broader community's interests. centralization of governance can result in protocol changes that benefit a few at the expense of others.

**Token Distribution:** If a significant portion of tokens is held by a small number of entities, they can exert substantial influence over the protocol's direction and decisions.

**Developer Centralization:** If a small group of developers or a single development team has a monopoly on protocol development, it can lead to a lack of diversity in ideas and potential conflicts of interest.

## Architecture recommendations
* Although reorgs attacks are handled by LayerZero including the hashing and mapping the deposit info to a specific user would also provide greater security.
* When dealing with Multi-chain transactions it would be best to allow users to provide the intended recipient rather than hardcoding to msg.sender

## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
* Read through the provided docs.
* Skim through the repos provided and take note of relevant points.
* Write simple POCs to verify/clarify any doubt either using chisel or forge test.
* Proceed with quality assurance (QA) and report writing.
